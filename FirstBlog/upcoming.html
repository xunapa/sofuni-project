                    <p>When Miocic defends his strap Saturday at UFC 226 against light heavyweight champ Daniel Cormier (only the heavyweight title
                        is on the line), he'll be a significant favorite to succeed, according to OddsShark.
                        Cormier is a sensational competitor in his own right. You can't do much about height, though, and the five inches
                        he surrenders to Miocic, not to mention the entire stand-up phase, are difficult challenges.
                        Great or not, there's far more at work and at stake here than the fight. This is an inflection point for Miocic,
                        a man who has proved all he can as a fighter but remains relatively unheralded in the MMA and general publics.
                        Cormier may very well be the perfect counterpoint to help Miocic cross one final bridge to legend status.
                        You see, Miocic suffers from a bit of an image problem. Many view him as boring, a flat soda in the champagne room
                        of the sport's most glamorous division. There's no telling how many questions Miocic has answered, only to face a
                        follow-up question about the way he answers questions.
                        It's true that Miocic relies heavily on cliches when he's under the spotlight, almost as if the world record for
                        cliches per minute is coming into reach. You might think the inventor of "it is what it is" has offered Miocic a
                        fee for every utterance. It's not exactly the kind of stuff that draws in the eyeballs.
